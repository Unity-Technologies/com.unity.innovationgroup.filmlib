# Main Toolbar 

The Main Toolbar is a very simple custom Editor window with a few 
buttons that point to some of the tools included in the Sherman project.

From left to right, the buttons are:

- Scene Loader - scans the ‘Scenes’ folder for any ‘SceneLoader’ scriptable object and displays a button that navigates to the 	file in the Project window
- Search Project - a shortcut that sets the input focus to the ‘Search’ field in the Project window
- Create Group - automatically adds a parent GameObject with the selected objects in the current scene (also accessible by 	the keyboard shortcut (CTRL + Alt + G)
- Center Group - Sets the pivot of the group to the center of the children
- Remap Materials - opens the Material Remapper window (requires the Film / TV Toolbox package to be available in the project)
- Render Window - opens the Render Window (see Module.RenderWindow for documentation)
- Load Film Layout - switches the editor to the Film Layout (see Module.Layout for documentation)
